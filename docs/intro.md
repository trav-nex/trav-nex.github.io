# Welcome to Wiil

Let's build **intelligent AI assistants in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating your first AI assistant**.

Or **try Wiil immediately** with our **[interactive guides](/quick-guides)**.

### What you'll need

- A Wiil account - [Sign up for free](https://wiil.io)
- Basic understanding of your business requirements:
  - What tasks should your assistant handle?
  - Which channels will customers use to contact you?
  - What knowledge should your assistant have access to?

## Create your first assistant

Build your first AI assistant using our **guided setup process**.

The guided setup will walk you through each step and get your assistant ready for deployment:

1. **Define your use case** - Sales, support, scheduling, or custom workflows
2. **Train your assistant** - Upload knowledge, set personality, define actions  
3. **Deploy everywhere** - Go live on phone, web, SMS, and social channels

You can start this process from your dashboard or follow our step-by-step guides.

## Quick Setup Path

Follow our interactive guide to get started:

```
Dashboard → Quick Setup → Choose Assistant Type → Configure Role → Deploy
```

The guided setup process automatically configures your assistant with best practices and gets you deployed in minutes.
