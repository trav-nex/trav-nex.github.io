# How to Create Assistant Role

Design and configure custom roles that define your assistant's behavior, personality, and specific capabilities for unique business scenarios.

## Overview

Assistant roles are the foundation of your AI assistant's behavior. They define what your assistant can do, how it communicates, what knowledge it can access, and how it handles different situations.

## Understanding Assistant Roles

### What is an Assistant Role?
An assistant role is a comprehensive configuration that includes:
- **Behavioral guidelines**: How the assistant should act
- **Knowledge access**: What information it can use
- **Task permissions**: What actions it can perform
- **Communication style**: How it should speak with customers

### Role vs Assistant Type
- **Assistant Type**: The underlying AI model and capabilities (Voice, Chat, etc.)
- **Assistant Role**: The specific instructions and personality for that assistant
